 DevOps:- 
    Linux           Operating system. first you need to learn how to use any OS 
                            Benefit e hau... that you have UNIX machine. Linux = Unix
    
    Networking      Basics of Networking. 
    
    Github              Place where you store your projects. and everyone can see it 
                            or work on that. 

                        Developer --------Customer. 
                            made and app            customer will get that app 
                                for Customer                from github. 
                        Dev again made another          
                        version of that app.            customer again will get that app
                                                            from github. 
                                You work in a team.                           
    Docker              You have MAC machine. 
                            and I have windows machine. 
                            You work on same project. like me. 
                            You deployed your project. and you send it to me. 

                            but that project doesn't run on my machine. 

                            then I will say that your code doesn't work. 

                            But I works on my machine. 

                        Because Mac supports other application. 
                        But windows supports other application. 

                        Thats way Docker came into the place. 
                        Docker:- 
                                In docker file, you already define the 
                                Machine name, there os, there hardware infrastructure.

    AWS             this is a cloud storage platform. 
                
                In ancient time, all the companies have there own data centers. 
                Benefits:-
                        Data Security.
                        User have more trust on you. 
                        Data can be used according to you. 
                Disadvantage:-
                        If you have your own datacenters then you have to 
                        keep expert for there maintatenance. 

                        Datacenters usually takes more space. 

                        Suppose you need only 1000 User space but as you know 
                        in future you will need 1 million space then in advance 
                        you need to buy all the infrastructure.

                        Then it is not cose effective. 
                        Expensive. 

                AWS came into the market:- 
                        AWS will only charge limited amount of bill that you 
                        have been used. 

                        Scaling became easy in aws. 

                        You don't have to maintain. so you no need to keep 
                        expert for there maintatenance. 

                So for  this cloud developer and cloud engineer came into the 
                place.
